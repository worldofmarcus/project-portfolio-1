                    <p>Today almost everyone can record music and sounds in their own home. We encourage you to do that
                        but if you want to step up the game our great sounding studios offer the most advanced digital
                        sound software and the best within classic analogue equipment. When you do your recordings at
                        Creative Dreams we will make your dreams sound excellent!

                    <h3>Mixing <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i></h3>
                    <p>The art of mixing is about blending all the recorded individual tracks to create the best
                        possible sounding version of the song. Today there are a lot of mixing software that can be used
                        at home to mix tracks but Creative Dreams can help you to put that little extra in the mix. With
                        our experience and knowledge we guarantee top results!

                    <p>To master a track you need to know both your art and science because it is a very complex
                        process. There are a lot of good mastering software for home use but to be honest, you often
                        need professionals by your side. We are those professionals and we have the skills to perfectly
                        balance, compress, enhance and equalize your recorded material!

                        <span>'a group problem-solving technique that involves the spontaneuous contribution of ideas

                        Artist Y started their journey back in 1999 when they recorded their first EP at Creative
                        Dreams. The EP included four songs where of two peaked at the Swedish charts during three months
                        of 1999. Of course Creative Dreams wanted to continue the cooperation with Artist Y and during
                        2000 the journey continued.
                        <span>'We where in need of a new sound and the brainstorming session with Creative Dreams was
                            fantastic. Before we knew it we had recorded four new songs that
