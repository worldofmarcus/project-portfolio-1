                <h2>Recording <i class="fa-solid fa-record-vinyl"></i></h2>
                <p>Today almost everyone can record music and sounds in their own home. We encourage you to do that but
                    if you want to step up the game our great sounding studios offer the most advanced digital sound
                    software and the best within classic analogue equipment. When you do your recordings at Creative
                    Dreams we will make your dreams sound excellent!

                <h2>Mixing <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i></h2>
                <p>The art of mixing is about blending all the recorded individual tracks to create the best possible
                    sounding version of the song. Today there are a lot of mixing software that can be used at home to
                    mix tracks but Creative Dreams can help you to put that little extra in the mix. With our experience
                    and knowledge we guarantee top results!

                <h2>Mastering <i class="fa-solid fa-volume-high"></i></h2>
                <p>To master a track you need to know both your art and science because it is a very complex process.
                    There are a lot of good mastering software for home use but to be honest, you often need
                    professionals by your side. We are those professionals and we have the skills to perfectly balance,
                    compress, enhance and equalize your recorded material!

                <h2>Brainstorming <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i></h2>
                <p>One definition of brainstorming is <span>a group problem-solving technique that involves the spontaneuous contribution of ideas from all members of the group</span>. Creative Dreams are professionals within the area of brainstorming and we can conduct high quality brainstorming sessions i.e. with you, your band, your record label. You will not be disappointed!
