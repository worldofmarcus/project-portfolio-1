### Features Left to Implement

In the future it would have been interesting to implement a hamburger-menu function when users are on a tablet / phone.

## Testing

Testing have been made on following browsers:

- Google Chrome Version (103.0.5060.114)
  - No bugs found
- Mozilla Firefox (version 102.0.1)
  - No bugs found
- Min (version 1.25.1)
  - No bugs found
- Apple Safari (version 15.5)
  - So far I have only found one bug in Safari. The hover effect on the log doesn't work properly. I believe the reason is a rgba bug in Safari connected to opacity.
- Microsoft Edge (version 103.0.1264.62)
  - No bugs found
  
### General bugs
**2022-07-14**
- Bug: Hover effect on logo not working properly on Safari.
- Bug: Challenges with portfolio section. Grid system not responsive. I think it has to do with the video content. Need a solution to that. **Update 2022-07-16** Fixed responsiveness problem for video/audio content by adding max width to Video and Audio elements.

**2022-07-16**
- Bug: When changing to @media 950px and and below the logo isn't 100% centered. I tried to fix it by removing letter-spacing on the font awesome-symbol, it got better but didn't solve the problem fully. It look's good enough but I need to check this later on in the project. 

### Validator Testing

- From the source section drop-down menu, select the main Branch (can be master in some cases but for me it was main)
