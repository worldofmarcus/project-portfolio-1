# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for Creative Dreams were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile decice. Relevant text content had not been written when the wireframes was produced. The final site has som smaller visual differences compared to the wireframes due to design choices that was being made during the process of creation.

![Wireframes](readme/assets/images/creative_dreams_mockup_v0.9.png)

## Structure
The Creative Dreams website has five pages. The first four pages are accessable through a sticky navigation menu in the top of the [home page](index.html). The links are anchor links that gets highlighted after being clicked to make sure the user knows where they are on the page. There is also a [form confirmation page](form-confirmation.html) that the user will come to after clicking the submit button in the contact form on the home page. The thank you page has clear instructions how to get back to the main page (both through direct link and top menu).

## Design Choices

* ### Color Scheme
The color scheme chosen for Creative Dreams is based on different shades of gray. The user gets no surprises regarding the colors on the site and the choice of colors creates a sense of calmness, structure and modern look.

OBS! LÄGG IN DE FAKTISKA FÄRGERNA SOM ANVÄNTS HÄR -> For beast readability and clean look white colour was chosen for the bacgkround, "Black Chocolate #272722" for text. I chose "Light Salmon #FF9F76" colour for hover, buttons and navigation elements to stand out and delicate "Miami Pink #FFD9EA" for sections background. "French Bistre #7A6D5B" colour was used for text in the footer. "Light Gray #D0D2D6" was used for boxes shadow effect and form input hover.

* ### Typography
The fonts used on the Creative Dreams website are 'Montserrat' and 'Oswald'. Fallback font for both of them is sans-serif.

  * 'Montserrat' was chosen due to it's clean and almost 'poster-like' look. It's being used both as headlines and in running text.
  * 'Oswald' was chosen to the quote plate on the hero image to get the users attention with its more intense look.
Both fonts are easy to read and creates a good contrast to the background.

## Testing

Testing have been made on following browsers:

- Google Chrome Version (103.0.5060.114)
  - No bugs found
- Mozilla Firefox (version 102.0.1)
  - No bugs found
- Min (version 1.25.1)
  - No bugs found
- Apple Safari (version 15.5)
  - So far I have only found one bug in Safari. The hover effect on the log doesn't work properly. I believe the reason is a rgba bug in Safari connected to opacity.
- Microsoft Edge (version 103.0.1264.62)
  - No bugs found
  
### General bugs
**2022-07-14**
- Bug: Hover effect on logo not working properly on Safari.
- Bug: Challenges with portfolio section. Grid system not responsive. I think it has to do with the video content. Need a solution to that. **Update 2022-07-16** Fixed responsiveness problem for video/audio content by adding max width to Video and Audio elements.

**2022-07-16**
- Bug: When changing to @media 950px and and below the logo isn't 100% centered. I tried to fix it by removing letter-spacing on the font awesome-symbol, it got better but didn't solve the problem fully. It look's good enough but I need to check this later on in the project.
