## **Site Users Goal**

The site will help reaching out to potential new customers and clients which will increase the inflow of warm leads. The outcome will be strenghtened branding and increased revenue.

# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for Creative Dreams were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Relevant text content had not been written when the wireframes was produced. The final site has some smaller visual differences compared to the wireframes due to design choices that was being made during the process of creation.

![Wireframes](readme/assets/images/creative_dreams_mockup_v0.9.png)

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)
## Site Structure
The Creative Dreams website has five pages. The first four pages are accessable through a sticky navigation menu in the top of the [home page](index.html). The links are anchor links that gets highlighted after being clicked to make sure the user knows where they are on the page. There is also a [form confirmation page](form-confirmation.html) that the user will be sent to after clicking the submit button in the contact form on the home page. The confirmation page has clear instructions how to get back to the main page (both through direct link and top menu).

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)
## Design Choices

* ### Color Scheme
  The color scheme chosen for Creative Dreams is based on different shades of gray. The user gets no surprises regarding the colors on the site and the choice of colors creates a sense of calmness, structure and modern look. Colors have been chosen to create good readability and contrast (background color on the body: #FFF, background on all sections: #F3F3F3, text color: #5F5F5F, box shadow with opacity: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4).
  
![Color Palette image](readme/assets/images/colormind_palette.png)

* ### Typography
  The fonts used on the Creative Dreams website are 'Montserrat' and 'Oswald'. Fallback font for both of them is sans-serif. Both fonts are easy to read and creates a good contrast to the background.

  * 'Montserrat' was chosen due to it's clean and almost 'poster-like' look. It's being used both as headlines and in running text.
  * 'Oswald' was chosen for the quote plate on the hero image to get the users attention with its more intense look.

# Testing

## Code Validation
The Creative Dreams has been tested through both [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Minor errors were found on the Form Confirmation Page but could easily be fixed.

### HTML Validator
The HTML validator results for each page can be seen below:

* Home Page

No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

![HTML Result Home Page](readme/assets/images/html_result_home_page.png)

* Form Confirmation page

Some minor errors were reported. The errors were generated by two faulty div elements in form_confirmation.html.

![HTML Result Form Confirmation With Errors](readme/assets/images/html_result_form_with_errors.png)

It was easy to fix and when the page was re-run in the validator no errors were returned.

## Browser Compatibility

Creative Dreams website was tested on the following browsers on desktop, tablet and phone with no visible issues for the user. 

* Google Chrome Version (103.0.5060.114)
* Mozilla Firefox (version 102.0.1)
* Min (version 1.25.1)
* Apple Safari (version 15.5)
* Microsoft Edge (version 103.0.1264.62)

## Additional Testing

### WAVE

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to check accessibility. 0 errors and 31 alerts was found. 17 of the alerts were connected to justified text which in the context isn't a critical issue. The rest of the alerts were connected to the video/audio (*lack of synchronized captions and transcripts*) which isn't critical in this context.

![WAVE Result](readme/assets/images/wave_result.png)

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### Lighthouse
[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the website for *Performance*, *Accessibility*, *Best Practices* and *SEO*. The testing showed that the *Accessability*, *Best Practices* and *SEO* was 100%. The Performance fluctuated between 83 and 90. The main reason for the decreased performance is the audio/video clips on the site (*and to some extent the hero image*) even after compression.

**Lighthouse result Main Page**

### Peer Review
Additional testing of the site was conducted mainly by people outside of the software development field. Some spelling and grammar errors were found and corrected. In general there were no challenges with the design.

## Known bugs

**2022-07-14**
* Bug: Hover effect on logo not working properly on Safari. **Update 2022-07-20** Fixed by changing color from RGBA to #.
* Bug: Challenges with portfolio section. Grid system not responsive. I think it has to do with the video content. Need a solution to that. **Update 2022-07-16** Fixed responsiveness problem for video/audio content by adding max width to Video and Audio elements.

**2022-07-16**
* Bug: When changing to @media 950px and and below the logo isn't 100% centered. I tried to fix it by removing letter-spacing on the font awesome-symbol, it got better but didn't solve the problem fully. It look's good enough but I need to check this later on in the project.  **2022-07-16** Bug fixed, the problem was the padding property (*changed to 0*).

### Unfixed Bugs
* 2022-07-20 No known bugs
